Not done too much publicly but what I have done is listed below:

* 2013 London BSides Rookie Track -  [Blinking Hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkNb_LQt9FU)
    Using Key Lock States to transmit data off of a host via VBA and a wee little microcontroller known as a teensy.
* 2022 Steelcon Track 3 - [P4ssw0rds!!!!111](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mh3-Z6bScc)
    Talk built up over years of managing password cracking rigs for a large security consultancy and forever being frustrated by people just treating password cracking as assumed knowledge.
